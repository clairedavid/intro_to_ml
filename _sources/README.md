# Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is this?

This repository holds the online pages of my course Introduction to Machine Learning.

The course uses [Jupyter-Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) as a wrapper for displaying lecture content and exercises.

You can access the published version [here](https://clairedavid.github.io/intro_to_ml).

This course has been mostly delivered at the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)](https://nexteinstein.org) in Senegal, Cameroon, Ghana and South Africa. For the latter, it is taught as part of the [AI for Science](https://ai.aims.ac.za/) Master's program.
