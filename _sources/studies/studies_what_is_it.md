# What is STEP?

<br>

## STEP = Study Through Exploration and Presentation

<br>

Halfway through the course, youâ€™ll choose an aspect of machine learning that sparks your curiosity and investigate it.  

The STEP has three goals:

````
1. __Deepen your knowledge__
<br> Your own questions will be your guidance. Choose what you most want to grasp and build intuition around.  
<br>

1. __Get hands-on__
<br> Design a small coding demo to highlight your main results. A Jupyter notebook is very pedagogical, but the output format is totally free... as long as it validates the goal 3.  
<br>

1. __Nail a crystal-clear presentation that effortlessly sparks understanding of your peers__
<br> In other words: Be a Teacher!<sup>*</sup> The STEP is a pretext to sharpen your didactical skills, and to train yourself toward becoming an outstanding speaker. Think of how many opportunities open if you are an excellent communicator. Direct bonus: this will give you a confidence boost that lasts.

```{admonition} Group size
:class: warning
For the STEP, you can work in groups of 2 or 3. Exceptions can be made if you want to be solo or in a group of 4 (case of an ambitious STEP where workload can be ealsity divided). This will have to be validated by the instructor.
```
<br>

The presentations will happen during the last lecture (with double the time to fit all groups).  
<br>

````{margin}
<br><br><br><sup>*</sup> Remember to have fun. Always.
````
```{admonition} Two constraints
:class: important
1. The final presentation should be __10 minutes__ long.
1. Throughout the process, you must maximize the __fun function__.

```
