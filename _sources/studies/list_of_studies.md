# Study Through Exploration & Presentation (STEP)


## What is it? 

Halfway through the course, youâ€™ll choose an aspect of machine learning that sparks your curiosity and investigate it.  

The STEP has three goals:


1. __Deepen your knowledge__ 
<br> Your own questions will be your guidance. Choose what you most want to grasp and build intuition around.

1. __Test__



Half way through the course, you will pick an aspect of machine learning of your choice and perform a little investigation around it. The goal is threefold: 
1. Dive into an aspect of ml you are curious about and increase your knowledge, purely guided by [you need to ask yourself the questions and that's the guidance]
1. Design yourself some hands-on with code to illustrate [that new knowledge/your results]. The most adapted [fantastically pedagogical] format is a Jupyter-notebook, but the format is totally free, from the moment you check the last goal (3)
1. You turn into teacher and prepare a presentation about your findings, teaching your peers. This STEP is a pretext to train you to extract and structure the information so as to [be a great teacher --> but it's not the school scheme here, just very general, no matter what the students will do later] and oral skills. --> I Like 'outstanding' but it can put pressur. I want to say that this little mission will help students gain confidence in their didactical potential and speaker... as in life, a lot of convincing/negotiation/people-marketing goes with great speaker 'skills' or profile... yep.


I give you two constraints with the STEP:
- the presentation should be 10 minute long.
- through the entire process, you have to maximize the 'fun'<sup>*</sup> function
