# Evaluation

In this course, all exercises given in class as well as the tutorials are not graded. Instead, there will be daily audit sessions: short, individual oral assessments to check your mastery of the key concepts and tutorial questions. Participants will be randomly sampled ðŸ¤­ so that everyone is audited at least twice over the duration of the course.

The quizzes will be multiple-choice written exams, invigilated on desktop computers. A mock quiz will be provided so participants can get a sense of the style and type of questions. The quizzes are designed to verify a top-notch understanding of the core concepts. If it's not, you will realize it!

The course concludes with a longer, individual oral exam. Participants will be asked questions on concepts and may also be shown code snippets to interpret or comment on. This evaluation mode is excellent preparation for future interviews. Participants will be trained during the course to formulate concise, to-the-point answers. An added benefit, beyond passing the course: a boost of confidence to nail future interviews!
