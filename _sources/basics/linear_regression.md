# Warm-up: Linear Regression

The mathematics of machine learning are introduced through a simple situation that may be already familiar: ‘fitting a straight line’.

Here are some of the objectives of this section:
- Become familiar with the terminology and notation commonly used in Machine Learning
- Understand the definition and purpose of a cost function
- Understand the concept of a learning rate and its role in optimization
- Gain intuition for gradient descent as an iterative method for minimizing the cost function
- Develop skill in interpreting Machine Learning algorithms presented as pseudo-code
