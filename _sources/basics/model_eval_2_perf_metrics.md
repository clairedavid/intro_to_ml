# Performance Metrics

In supervised learning, assessing a model's performance is about how close predictions are to the truth. Before digging into the metrics, let's first define the types of errors properly.

## Types of errors
Generally speaking, an error is the gap between the prediction and the true value. There are different terms depending on the algorithm and the set on which errors are computed. 

### For regression algorithms
````{prf:definition}
:label: residualDef
A __residual__ is the difference between the actual and predicted value computed with respect to data samples used to train, validate and tune the model (i.e. _in-sample_ error).
````
It is always a good practice to make a scatter plot of all the residuals with respect to the independent variable values; they should be randomly distributed on a band symmetrically centered at zero. If not, this means the chosen model is not appropriate to correctly fit the data.

````{prf:definition}
:label: errorDef
The __generalized error__ is the error rate of the difference between the actual and predicted values computed with respect to test or new data (i.e. _out-of-sample_ error).
````
### For classification algorithms
In classification, the errors bear different names. As we saw that multiclassifiers are treated as a collection of binary classifiers, we will go over the two types of errors. 
The most common metric is the root mean squared error (RMSE).

Recall than the labelling and numerical association (1 and 0) of classes is arbitrary. Signal can be the rare process we want to see in the detector and 0 the background we want to reject. But we could exchange the numbers with 0 and 1, provided we remain consistent. In medical diagnosis, the class labelled 1 can be the presence of cancer on a patient (it's not what we want of course, but what we are looking to classify). 

````{prf:definition}
:label: confusionMatrix def
The __confusion matrix__ is a table used to visualize the prediction results (positive/negative) from a classification algorithm with respect to their correctness (true/false).  
It is a $n^C \times n^C$ matrix, with $n^C$ the number of classes.

The quantity in each cell $C_{i,j}$ corresponds to the number of observations known to be in group $i$ and predicted to be in group $j$.
The true cells are along the diagonal when $i=j$. Otherwise, if $i \neq j$, it is false. For $n^C =2$ there are two ways to be right, two ways to be wrong. The counts are called:
* $C_{0,0}$: true negatives
* $C_{1,1}$: true positives
* $C_{0,1}$: false positives
* $C_{1,0}$: false negatives

Here is a rephrase in the context of event classification: signal (1) versus background (0).


__True positives__  
We predict signal and the event is signal.

__True negatives__  
We predict background and the event is background.

__False positives__  
We predict signal but the event is background: our signal samples will have background contamination.

__False negatives__  
We predict background but the event is signal: we have signal contamination in the background but most importantly: we missed a signal event!

The false positive and false negatives misclassifications are also referred to as type I and type II errors respectively. There are usually phrased using statistical jargon of null hypothesis (background) and alternative hypothesis (signal). The definitions below merge the statistical phrasing with our context above:


````{prf:definition}
:label: 
__Type I error - False Positive__  
Error of rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.  
ðŸ‘‰ Background is classified as signal (background contamination)

__Type II error - False Negative__  
Error of accepting the null hypothesis when the alternative one is actually true.  
ðŸ‘‰ Signal is classified as background (missing out on what we look for)

````

The type I error leads to signal samples not pure, as contaminated with background. But a type II error is a miss on a possible discovery! Or in medical diagnosis, it can be equivalent to state "you are not ill" to a sick patient. Type II errors are in some cases and contexts much worse than type I errors.


## Performance measures

### For regression algorithms
There are many metrics used to evaluate the performance of regression algorithms, each with theirs pros and cons. 

````{prf:definition}
:label: rmseDef
The __root mean squared error (RMSE)__ is the square root of the mean squared error:
\begin{equation}
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (y^\text{pred} - y^\text{obs} )^2 }{ N } }
\end{equation}
````
RMSE ranges from 0 to infinity. The lower the RMSE, the better. By taking the square root we have an error of the same unit that the target variable $y$ we want to predict.

You may have seen in a statistics course the coefficient of determination, called $R^2$ or $r^2$. This is not really a measure of model performance, although it can be used as a proxy. What $r^2$ does is to measure of the amount of variance explained by the model. It is more a detector of variance than a performance assessment. Ranging from 0 to 1, with 1 being ideal. 


### For classification algorithms

The total model error, i.e. the sum of all wrong predictions divided by the total number of predictions, is not a good metric as it mixes types I and II errors. There are other error measurements more appropriate to measure the performance for classification. The more popular ones associated with machine learning are defined below:

````{prf:definition}
:label: errormetricsclassdef

&nbsp;  
__Accuracy__  
Rate at which the model is able to predict the correct values of both classes.
\begin{equation}
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{True predictions}}{\text{All predictions}} = \frac{\text{TP + TN}}{\text{TP + TN + FP + FN}}
\end{equation}

&nbsp;  
__Precision, or Positive Predictive Value (PPV)__  
Measure of the fraction of true predictions among all __positive predictions__.
\begin{equation}
\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{All Positive Predictions}} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}
\end{equation}

&nbsp;  
__Recall, or True Positive Rate (TPR)__  
Measure of the fraction of true predictions among all __true observations__.
\begin{equation}
\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{Actual Positives}} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}
\end{equation}

&nbsp;  
__F-Score, or F1__  
Describes the balance between Precision and Recall. It is the harmonic mean of the two:
\begin{equation}
\text{F1} =2 \; \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
\end{equation}
````

The F-Score is a single metric favouring classifiers with similar Precision and Recall. But in some contexts, it is preferrable to favour a model with either high precision and low recall, or vice versa. There is a known trade-off between precision and recall. 


__Case of unbalanced dataset__  
In an unbalanced dataset, some classes will appear much more frequently that others. A specific metric called balanced accuracy is used to assess the performance in that case. 
````{prf:definition}
:label: balancedaccdef
__Balanced accuracy__ is calculated as the average of recall obtained on each class.
````
